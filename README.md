# Introduction

Climate change is a global phenomenon that involves ongoing changes in average temperatures and weather patterns.
Extreme weather events and catastrophes emanating from global warming such as hurricanes, floods and fires, have a direct impact on 70% of all economic sectors worldwide.

Many business leaders are now acknowledging the business imperative of climate change and increasingly understand it to be an existential threat that has far-reaching consequences for their people and business operations. A warming planet creates a wide range of risks for businesses, from disrupted supply chains to rising insurance costs to labor challenges.

This new reality has forced many companies to explore ways to lessening their environmental impact and carbon footprint through offering products and services that are environmentally friendly, sustainable, and in line with their values and ideals.
