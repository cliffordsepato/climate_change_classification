# About this Project 

Many companies are built around lessening oneâ€™s environmental impact or carbon
footprint. They offer products and services that are environmentally friendly and
sustainable, in line with their values and ideals. They would like to determine how
people perceive climate change and whether or not they believe it is a real threat.
This would add to their market research efforts in gauging how their
product/service may be received.
With this context, EDSA is challenging you during the Classification Sprint with the
task of creating a Machine Learning model that is able to classify whether or not a
person believes in climate change, based on their novel tweet data.
Providing an accurate and robust solution to this task gives companies access to a
broad base of consumer sentiment, spanning multiple demographic and
geographic categories - thus increasing their insights and informing future
marketing strategies.
